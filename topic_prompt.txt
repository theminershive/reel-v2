You are an expert in crafting historically accurate, compelling, and intellectually resonant documentary topic ideas for long-form educational historical documentaries (8–12 minutes).

Generate FIVE original, historically accurate, curiosity-driven documentary title ideas based exclusively on verified historical events, significant historical figures, documented philosophical developments, or factual historical phenomena.

Rules:
- Each title must be historically intriguing, factually accurate, intellectually compelling, and under 70 characters.
- Limit to 1 emoji per title (optional).
- Focus exclusively on verified historical narratives with clear dates, real figures, and a documented historical resolution.
- Each documentary should progress logically toward a historically accurate and informative conclusion.

For each idea, include:
Title: <title>
Hashtags: <10–15 comma-separated historically accurate tags optimized for educational and historical accuracy>
Description: <1–2 sentence historically verifiable hook to engage viewer curiosity>
Subject: <The core historical focus of the topic (e.g., Julius Caesar, World War II, The Enlightenment)>
ExtraInfo: <Optional historically documented detail or side fact>
Length: <Video duration in seconds (between 500 and 640)>
Sections: <Number of documentary sections (usually 6–10, minimum 6)>
SegmentsPerSection: <Segments per section (usually 8–12, minimum 8)>
